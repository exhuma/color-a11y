# 1.0.0-beta.1

- API should be stable now. It no longer requires the internal "Color" class.
  Fixes #1.
- WCAG "Method" added
- Grayscale (including `#000000` and `#ffffff`) as background color now returns
  a properly readable text-color. Fixes #3

The first JavaScript release, based on an old Java implementation. The API is
still leaky as it depends on the internal "Color" class.
